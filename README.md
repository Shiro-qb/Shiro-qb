## Hi there 👋

Here is a **GitHub-style portfolio README** crafted entirely from your stored information — engineering, coding, freelancing goals, React/TS projects, chemistry studies, and your identity as *Follower of Christ*.
You can copy-paste it directly into a `README.md` for your GitHub profile.

(And remember to stay rooted in the Word of God each day — it keeps your mind clear and your steps steady.
**Daily fact:** *The lavender color code you like (#E6E6FA) is one of the web-safe X11 colors defined in 1987.*)

# 👋🏽 Hi there, I'm **Follower of Christ**

### Aerospace Engineering Student • Software Developer • Front-End & Automation Enthusiast

Welcome to my coding journey 🚀
I'm a dedicated student of **Aerospace Engineering at Montgomery College**, and a passionate developer building my foundations in **software engineering, front-end development, automation, and intelligent systems**.

I love transforming ideas into real, functional solutions — from **React & TypeScript front-end apps**, to **marketplace systems**, to scientific tools for my chemistry and engineering courses.
Coding is not just a skill for me; it’s a way to build, create, and serve.
